# Call for papers

The ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS) is the premier international forum for the presentation of research results in high-performance computing systems. The 39th edition of ICS will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA from June 8th-11th, 2025.
Papers are solicited on all aspects of the architecture, software, and applications of high-performance computing systems of all scales (from chips to supercomputing systems), including but not limited to:

- Processor, accelerator, memory, storage, interconnect and system architectures, including architectures based on future and emerging hardware (e.g. quantum, superconducting, photonic, neuromorphic).
- Programming languages, paradigms and execution models, including domain-specific languages and scientific problem-solving software environments.
- Compilers, runtime systems and system software, including optimization and support for hardware resources and energy management.
- High-performance algorithms and applications including machine learning and large-scale data analytics, as well as the implementation and deployment of algorithms and applications on large-scale systems.
- Tools for measurement, modeling, analysis and visualization of performance, energy, or other quantitative properties of high-performance computing systems.
  
**Paper submission sites:** 
- Cycle 1: [https://ics25.hotcrp.com](https://ics25.hotcrp.com)
- Cycle 2: To be posted

The papers will be evaluated based on novelty, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field.
The review process includes a rebuttal, and the discussions by the committee will take the authorsâ€™ rebuttal into account.
Papers accepted for this conference will be published in the ACM proceedings. ACM's publication policy is as follows.

- By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
