### **Public Transportation**

Salt Lake City has a robust public transportation system that  utilizes commuter trains, buses, and light-rail to provide you with  access from the [**airport**](https://www.visitsaltlake.com/plan-your-visit/transportation/airports-airlines/) all the way up to the University of Utah.

**Light-rail** lines, called **TRAX**,  provide access to Downtown from across the valley on three color-coded  lines. Downtown Salt Lake provides a great transfer point as all the  lines run through downtown.

**You can take the [Red Line](https://www.rideuta.com/Rider-Tools/Schedules-and-Maps/703-Red-Line) on TRAX from downtown that will  drop you off at the Fort Douglas stop and it’s a short walk to the  Alumni House.**


Get complete route and schedule details for Salt Lake’s public transportation at [**rideuta.com**](http://www.rideuta.com/) 

There are buses that run from downtown up 200 South – Bus #2 will get from most places downtown. It will take you all the way up to the  University and drop you off at the corner on North Campus Drive  (Kennecott stop), where it is a short walk to the Alumni House.

Of course, Uber and Lyft are always options and we have a great system here.

UTA offers route and transit information in a variety of languages  through its interpreter program. This program is available by phone.  Call 801-743-3822 (801-RIDE-UTA) or call toll-free 888-743-3822.

Salt Lake City is laid out in a [**grid**](http://widestreetsofsaltlake.blogspot.com/2012/11/salt-lakes-grid-system-how-to.html) and is easy to get around once you understand it.
